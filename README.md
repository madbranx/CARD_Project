Project of the Course Computer Aided Reactor Design (CARD) of the
Institute of Chemical Process Engineering (CVT) at
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)

Authors: Till Kasselmann, Maximilian Brand (Group 1)\
Contact: till.kasselmann@student.kit.edu,
maximilian.brand@student.kit.edu\
Project Timespan: 12/2024 - 02/2025


Example calls for studies are provided in the main.py file.\
For an overview over the Programm structure refer to UML.pdf.\
The equation system and discretization is collected in CARD_Reactor_Equations_Overview.

In the current state the radial dispersion leads to numerical problems when solving and is therefore currently commented out in FixedbedReactor.py

The following packaged are needed to run the code:\
casadi 3.6.7 \
matplotlib 3.10.0\
numpy 2.2.2\
openpyxl 3.2.0b1\
pandas 2.2.3\
scipy 1.15.0
