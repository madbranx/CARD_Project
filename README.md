Project of the Course Computer Aided Reactor Design (CARD) of the
Institute of Chemical Process Engineering (CVT) at
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)

Project Timespan 12/2024 - 02/2025

Example calls for studies are provided in the main.py file.

For a overview over the Programm structure refer to UML.pdf

The equation system and discretization is collected in CARD_Reactor_Equations_Overview

In the current state the radial dispersion leads to numerical problems when solving and is therefore currently commented out in FixedbedReactor.py
