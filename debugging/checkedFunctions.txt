Parameters
	constant Parameters
	component Properties
	
FluidProperties
	rho cp eff
	mole fractions (corrected)
	partial pressures
	concentrations
	rho_comp -> difference to rho from material properties-> when using those also change rho_fl for consistency
	rho_fl
	Re (>300)
	Pr (0.719)
	massFraction_weighted_average

Kinetics
	rate Equation (corrected rho_cat unit conversion, missing **2 in rate eq) = 1.4025e-05 ?? correct? mol/m^3cat/s (seems low)

Mass Conservation
	fixed wrong implementation in FixedBed

Pressure Drop
	Ergun

Species Conservation (positive = removal from cell)
    axialMassFlow ~~ 0 because w_i = const over length
	Change by reaction (values for CO2) = 3.75345e-07 kg/m^3/s
		Knudsen 1.2664501554349599e-06
		Mixtureavg (with Fuller) 1.38097e-05
		eff Diff Koeff 1.74624e-07
		effFactor = 0.99 ?

Energy Conservation (negative = intake into volume) [delta_z = 0.5m]
    convectiveHeatFlux = 2151 [*delta_T / delta_z]
    radial heat flux (1D) = -10000000.0
    effAxialThermalConductivity = 3.12847 [*delta T / delta z **]  -> u* instead of u+ (fixed)
    Reaction Heat = -1.40637 (very low bc of low rate equation)
